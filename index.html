          <p>In West Philadelphia, born and raised, on the playground is where I spent most of my days. Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool and all shootin' some B-ball outside of the school, when a couple of guys who were up to no good started makin' trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared and said, "You're movin' with your aunty and uncle in Bel Air."

          I whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said fresh and had a dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare but I thought, nah forget it, yo home to Bel Air.

          I pulled up to the house about seven or eight and I yelled to the cabby, "Yo homes, smell you later". Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there, to sit on my throne as the prince of Bel Air.</p>
